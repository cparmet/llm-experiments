This repo contains notebooks that explore the use of open source LLMs in local environments. The models explored include lightweight versions of <b>Llama 3</b> by Meta and <b>Gemma 2</b> by Google.  
  
The notebooks are set up to run on Apple Silicon computers, such as an M1 MacBook.  
  
To run:
1. Clone this repo locally
2. [Install poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) on your machine if necessary
3. Navigate to the repo's root and run `poetry install`. This will create the virtual environment `llm-experiments` with the dependencies required by the notebooks.
4. Run the notebooks in your IDE, selecting the virtual environment `llm-experiments`
